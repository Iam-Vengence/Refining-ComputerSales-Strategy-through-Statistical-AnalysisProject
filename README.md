The statistical analysis project

Strategizing to enhance its computer sales performance, a leading computer manufacturing company has undertaken a comprehensive data collection initiative. This initiative aims to gather intricate details regarding their diverse range of computers, including pricing, processing speed, RAM capacity, and more. The primary objective is to unravel customer buying behaviors and discern potential areas for refinement and optimization within the company's sales strategy.
